/*
A lot of new concepts here
We are new-ing up a type of Scanner feeding into it the System input buffer.
We assign that new Scanner to a variable called userInputReader.
This essentially creates a tool for us to read user input in the console.
Next we print a line asking for the user's age
Next we declare a variable called age
Next we assign the age variable the value returned from calling the method nextLine from the userInputReader variable
This takes whatever the user inputted as a number, and everything to the right of the assignment operator (=) becomes the user input, another words the integer value age  
Lastly we print out a line, printing the users input back to him
