// declare a class named Exercise005
	// declare your main method
		// declare datatype String variable called firstName
		// declare datatype String variable called lastName

		// assign value "Elias" to firstName variable
		// assign value "Rosario" to lastName variable

		// Print a line passing in parameter firstName variable, concatenated with a String literal space character " ", also concatenated with lastname
	// end main
// end class



/*
Hint: concatenated elements have a + between them
Your doing something similar to the last exercise
but instead of printing your name on 2 lines, your printing it on one line separated by a space
